# Phases
I've created a comprehensive binary phase diagram app that shows interactive phase diagrams for two-element systems. Here are the key features:

Main Features:

Interactive Phase Diagrams: Temperature on Y-axis, composition on X-axis
Real-time Phase Detection: Shows current phase based on temperature and composition
Click-to-Explore: Click anywhere on the diagram to set specific conditions
Multiple Binary Systems: Fe-C, Ti-Al, Cu-Zn, Ni-Al, Mg-Zn with authentic phase regions
Interactive Controls:

Temperature slider (0-2000Â°C)
Composition slider (0-100% of element B)
Manual input fields for precise values
Quick preset buttons for common conditions
Element selection dropdowns
Visual Features:

Color-coded phase regions (Liquid, Austenite, Ferrite, Cementite, etc.)
Phase boundaries with proper curves
Crosshair indicators for current position
Interactive legend showing all phases
Grid lines for easy reading
Information Panels:

Detailed phase information with properties and applications
Crystal structure details
System information and temperature ranges
Phase stability indicators
The app accurately represents common metallurgical phase diagrams like the Fe-C system showing eutectoid transformations, Ti-Al system with intermetallic phases, and others. You can explore how phases change with temperature and composition variations in real-time!
